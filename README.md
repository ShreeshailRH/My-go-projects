# My-go-projects

This project is a simple REST API built using Go that performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on movies. It uses the built-in net/http package and JSON for request/response handling. The goal is to demonstrate how to build a lightweight API service in Go without external frameworks.
